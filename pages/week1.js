                            <p>This week, I worked on developing a website to document my progress through this course. Having worked pretty extensively with website development in the past, I chose to develop this website using React.js and Next.js <span>&#40;</span>as opposed to with the standard HTML/CSS templates provided in class<span>&#41;</span>.</p>
                            <p>In doing so, I have been able to create a much more modular and scalable design. With React, I created components for every page and for certain aspects <span>&#40;</span>such as header images<span>&#41;</span> which are frequently repeatedâ€”thereby allowing me to minimize the amount of code which is copied and pasted. Moreover, with Next, I have been able to manage routing, image optimization, and a variety of other important aspects to creating a functional website. </p>
                            <p>Indeed, while this method was probably more time consuming than simply modifying the provided templates, I think the results have been pretty rewarding!</p>

                            <h2>Option 1: Wake Up Manager</h2>
                            <p>The first project that I am considering making is an automated wake up system. As a very deep sleeper, I oftentimes sleep through my alarm, and I am in need of a more comprehensive solution. Much like an alarm clock, this project would have a speaker component that would play loud noises at a certain time to wake you up. However, unlike an alarm clock, the system would also be smarterâ€”connected to a stepper motor to open the blinds and let in natural sunlight, an IoT board <span>&#40;</span>like an Arduino<span>&#41;</span> so that the speaker can tell me important information like the weather, and maybe even a small water pump to spray me if I don't shut off the alarm.</p>
                            <p>This project would be somewhat similar to other "smart alarm clock" solutions such as <a href="https://allisonktu.github.io/PS70/01_intro/index.html" target="_blank" className={styles.link}>Allison's Smart Alarm Clock</a>, <a href="https://allisonktu.github.io/PS70/01_intro/index.html" target="_blank" className={styles.link}>The Loftie Clock Smart Sleep Assistant</a>, and even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Alarm-Clock/s?k=Echo+Alarm+Clock" target="_blank" className={styles.link}>Amazon Alexa Devices</a>. However, my project would connect to significantly more external components than these other solutions, and would thus give me plenty of opportunities to explore new technologies and ideas!</p>
                            <br />
                            <h2>Option 2: Plant Automation System</h2>
                            <p>Alternatively, I could create a plant automation system to keep my plants alive. Indeed, while my mom gave me two plants at the beginning of the school year, I managed to kill both last semester ðŸ˜­ As a result, I am in need of a more automated solution. Such a system could, for instance, monitor the moisture levels in the soil using a sensor as well as the amount of sunlight the plant is receiving. It could then drive motors to pump water into the plant or open the blinds nearby, respectively. As a stretch goal, I could also connect this system to the internet so that I could monitor the plant's wellbeing remotely.</p>
                            <p>However, this project is one which has already been done numerous timesâ€”in <a href="https://ninakchung.github.io/PHYSCI-70/11_final/index.html" target="_blank" className={styles.link}>Nina's Automatic Plant Waterer</a>, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Watering-Programmable-Waterproof-Distribution/dp/B09475MXLX" target="_blank" className={styles.link}>automatic plant waterer for potted plants</a>, and this <a href="https://sageandsill.com/products/smart-plant-moisture-light-nutrient-and-temperature-sensor?variant=39659349737669&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAiAuOieBhAIEiwAgjCvciRT8KL46BpfS5g027IcM2sadLqCSZ3nQtp2aA3CiJgvbVMFxeD8gRoCKWoQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" className={styles.link}>smart plant water meter and health sensor</a>. While my project would have <em>some</em> unique components <span>&#40;</span>such as automated blind control<span>&#41;</span>, I am leaning towards the first option due to its novelty.</p>
